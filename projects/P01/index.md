<!-- ### Project 01 – Sprint 1 Final Assessment (Rev 1.0)

#### Resources:
1. Completed Yahboom G1 Tank Robot build
2. VNC Remote Access
3. Visual Studio Code
4. Coding examples provided during Sprint 1 -->

---

<!-- #### Task:
Create a stop light simulation using the RGB LED provided on the piRover. This is the final assessment for Sprint 1 and is to be completed during the class session. Use all resources from Sprint 1, including notes and sample code. You must zip your files and submit them to the Moodle link by the end of the class session. **No late work will be accepted.**

---

#### Directions:

1. **Access the piRover**  
   - Start Visual Studio Code in your piRover working directory, and create a `week06` directory as demonstrated in previous sessions.

2. **Plan the Stop Light Timing**  
   - Consider typical timing for a stop light’s red, amber, and green sequence.  
   - Assuming a fast light with a total cycle time of 30 seconds, select appropriate delays for each state.

3. **Research RGB Colors**  
   - Using prior Yahboom code or other online resources, research how RGB colors work.  
   - **Challenge:** How do you create the amber color with an RGB LED?

4. **Create the Python File**  
   - In your `week06` folder, create a file named `p01_traffic_light.py`.  
   - **Note:** The instructor will be available on Zoom during the entire class session if any technical difficulties arise.

5. **Develop the Solution**  
   - Use the blink and beep code from the prior week as a guide.  
   - Steps:

     a. Import the required libraries.  
     b. Configure the GPIO pins as needed.  
     c. Modify the while loop of earlier solutions to cycle through the stop light stages: red, amber, and green.  
     d. Adjust the timing delays to simulate a stop light with a total cycle time of 30 seconds.

6. **Run and Test Your Solution**  
   a. Set a **debug breakpoint** at the line of code that configures the GPIO to use pin numbers, rather than the GPIO numbers (as used in Yahboom examples). This process was demonstrated in previous class sessions.  
   b. Run your code. When paused at the breakpoint, take a screenshot of the Visual Studio Code window.  
   c. Save this image as `traffic_light_code.jpg` (or `.png`).

7. **Submit Your Work**  
   a. Create a zip file containing both your traffic light code (`p01_traffic_light.py`) and the screenshot of your code window (`traffic_light_code.jpg` or `.png`).  
   b. Submit the zip file to the `P01` link on Moodle by the end of the class period.  
   **Note:** No late work will be accepted.
