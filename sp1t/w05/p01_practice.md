## P01 Practice Assessment – Instructions

Please complete the following steps in preparation for the **Wednesday P01 assessment**:

1. **Set up your workspace**

   * Connect to your piRover and open your VS Code workspace.
   * Create a new folder named **week05**.
   * Copy your `blink_beep.py` file from **week04** into the new **week05** folder.

2. **Modify your code**

   * Update your `blink_beep.py` solution so that **all LEDs turn on and off simultaneously**, producing white light.

3. **Test and debug**

   * Set a breakpoint in your program so you can **single-step through the code** and demonstrate the LEDs turning on and off.
   * If you cannot get your code to function correctly, or if you are having difficulty with breakpoints or single-stepping, **ask the instructor for assistance**.

4. **Create your Zoom video**

   * Once your `blink_beep.py` file is working, **leave the class Zoom session** and open a private Zoom meeting.
   * Record a video in which you:

     * Explain the coding requirements.
     * Share your screen to show your breakpoints.
     * Demonstrate the debugging process using single-step execution.
   * Save your recording to the Zoom cloud.

5. **Submit your work**

   * Submit the **Zoom recording URL** to the assignment link: *P01 Practice – Zoom Video URL*.
   * Upload your **week05** folder to Google Drive.
   * Download the zipped folder, then submit the **week05.zip** file to the assignment link: *P01 Practice – week05 zip*.

6. **Deadline**

   * Both the **Zoom video link** and the **week05.zip file** must be submitted by the **end of the class session**.
