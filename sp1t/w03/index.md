## piRover Builds by K2 - Course 1:Python

### [piRover01](../../) - [Sprint 1](../) - Week 03

W03 - During this week you continue to verify the function of your piRover by running the Yahboom Robot software on your mobile device. You'll also confirm that you can connect to the device remotely and that it is connected to the Internet.

**Session 1**

- Build updates and build videos from last week
  - issues or blockers
  - lessons learned?
