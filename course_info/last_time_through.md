Hello,

Welcome to RAM155, which begins next week!

I’m sending this email so you know what to expect and how to get started. We’ll review everything in detail on the first day of class, but here are the key points:

Canvas Access: Log into the NMC Canvas course to confirm class start times and review the syllabus. If you’re new to Canvas, don’t worry—tutorials are posted at the top of the course page, and we’ll walk through it together in class.

Class Meetings: This is a livestream class meaning that attendance is required. We will interact as a virtual team using the Zoom video conferencing tool. You will see the link to connect at the top of the course Canvas page. The first Zoom session is next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.

Technical Help: If you have trouble accessing Canvas, please contact the NMC Help Desk at 231-995-3020.

During our first sessions, we’ll go through the syllabus, tentative schedule, and course requirements.

I look forward to meeting you Tuesday afternoon!

Best,
Keith E. Kelly

About the Instructor
I’ve spent my career working at the crossroads of education and technology, helping students and professionals succeed in advanced tech fields. At NMC, I teach in the Engineering and Engineering Technology program and lead projects in computer science, robotics, and the makerspace. I enjoy building things—whether electronics, software, or new learning opportunities—and I look forward to bringing that same hands-on approach into our class.
