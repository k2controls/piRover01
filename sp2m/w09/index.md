## piRover Builds by K2 - Course 1:Python

### [piRover01](../../) - [Sprint 2](../) - Week 09

W09: Here you'll review line follower inputs from the prior week. piRover drive concepts will be introduced as you work toward having the line follower inputs control the drive output.

**Session 1**

- Sprint 2 schedule
  - Today - Week 09 Session 1
    - Line follower solution
    - User defined functions
    - Motor Control - version 1
  - Session 2 
    - Motor Controller - version 2
  - Week 10  
    - Introduction to PWM
    - Revised Drive code
  - Week 11 
    - Session 1 - P02 end of sprint project assigned.
    - Session 2 - *No Zoom class*
    - Submit P02 by end of the week 11
    - Debt and Retrospective

- [LineFollowerInput](../../lessons/28/LineFollowerInput.pdf){:target='_blank'}
  - Instructor will code solution
  - Student coding is optional. See assignments.

- User defined function - an introduction
  - create **hello_function.py**
  - enter coding along with instructor
  - set a breakpoint and test the use of parameters and return values.

- [Motor Control Introduction](../../lessons/29/MotorControllerIntro.docx){:target='_blank'}
  - *Note:* Be sure to have a fully charged battery moving forward. We will be energizing the motors. This will draw significant charge from the battery.
  - **[motor_control_intro.py](../../lessons/29/motor_control_intro.py){:target='_blank'}**
  
```console
wget https://k2controls.github.io/piRover01/lessons/29/motor_control_intro.py

```

**Session 2**

- Motor Control Introduction - continued
  - Add GPIO coding to motor_control_intro.py
  - Adjust logic enabling forward, backward, left turn, right turn, and stop
  - Testing including turns
  - **Lab check video required this week. See link on main course page.**

- motor_control_v2.py - the class will refactor the intro solution to remove delay parameters.
  - How does this change the main routine that calls motor functions?
